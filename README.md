Secure Federated Analytics for Privacy (SFAP)
Project Overview

This project demonstrates privacy-preserving healthcare analytics using Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP). We simulate two hospitals training a shared model for diabetes prediction using the Indian Diabetes Dataset, without exchanging raw patient data. Privacy is enhanced by adding noise during training using Opacus.
